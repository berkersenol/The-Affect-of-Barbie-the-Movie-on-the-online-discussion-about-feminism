# How has the Barbie Movie by Greta Gerwig influenced the online discussion about feminism?

## Explanation of the Problem
The Barbie Movie by Greta Gerwig was not only the highest-grossing film of 2023, but also the highest-grossing film by a solo female director and the highest-grossing film ever released by Warner Bros. Not only the enormous financial success of the film, but also its critical examination of the topic of feminism, underline the social relevance of the Barbie film. After its release, the film was widely discussed and criticized on various social media platforms, both positively and negatively. The aim of this paper was to explore whether and, if so, how Greta Gerwig's Barbie film has influenced the online discussion about feminism

##  Method

In order to approach this research question, all relevant posts regarding the Barbie Movie were extracted from the social media platforms TikTok and Reddit using the keyword "Barbie the movie". The appropriate APIs used to gather data from Reddit and Tiktok in order to look into the conversation surrounding "Barbie the Movie" and the correlation with the feminism subject. Community detection was implemented, and user behaviors and topics were explored. Sentiment analysis was used to analyze the movie's impact on feminism discussion.

## Results

The results show an increase in agency for Reddit after the release of the movie, while there is no change for TikTok. Affiliation, on the other hand, only increased for the TikTok community, but for Reddit. We conclude that the movie partially influenced online feminism discussion, reflecting key concepts but not introducing new aspects. Overall the movie didn't substantially diversify the discussion around feminism.
